#P.T Bindushree
Aspiring Data Science enthusiast 

I’m P.T. Bindushree, currently in my 7th semester (final year) of BTech in Computer Science at PES University, Bangalore. My academic journey has sparked a deep interest in the field of data science and AI/ML , and I’ve been actively exploring these areas through coursework, certifications, and hands-on projects.

Outside the classroom, I enjoy applying what I learn to real-world challenges, whether through research, collaborative projects, or independent exploration. As I approach graduation in 2026, I’m focused on deepening my understanding of data-driven technologies and preparing for higher studies abroad in data science.
